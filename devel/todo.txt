Overall: 

* Check units in BEGFR calculations 

* TADF and TAPD shift calculations not working... (collapse_uniwue not outputting a logical)

* II vs Freq scrips for chekcing unexpected changes - cannot use collapse_unique. try with distict insted. 

* Add tests for all functions

* All plot functions should be able to take a missingFlag and exclude that from the plots/print them as NA/missing

* generate azTheme




Datasets:  

1. Somwthing is weird with BW in the exisitng dataset. Might be good to include one additional dose level in this example

2. Dataset with large range of dose groups to test the dose proportionality functions

3. NONMEM output file to use with r_data_staructure, nm=T
