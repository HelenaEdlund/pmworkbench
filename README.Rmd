**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

R package serving as a repository for (sets of) template scripts: includes a combination of .R, .Rmd and .Rwd files. 

```{r}
library(xpmworkbench)
```

Create a new project folder via:

```{r}
init_project("<folder-to-create>")
```

## Download templates
Templates, including folder structures, are downloaded using init_report(). The templates are *not* executable files but to be seen as a templates. Modifications and setup are needed. 

Each project types have a read me documentation for what is required to use that particular set, which can be downloaded with get_report_readme(). 

## Planned expansions
Plans are to expand the set of templates as more people start using it. Next analysis type will likely be QT analysis (workflow + report) and then PK/PD analyses (probably stratified by therapeutic areas).
